# Pure Sense (IIoT)
PureSense brings you a portable solution to monitor indoor air quality. With a compact design, our device offers real-time data, allowing you to understand and manage the air you breathe. PureSense is created to be user-friendly, accessible, and effective in maintaining safe and healthy indoor environments.

## About us
We are a group of 5 people, who develop an air quality monitoring tool during our IIoT course at Taiwan Tech (National Taiwan University of Science).

## Hardware

### Components
Our air quality monitoring solution is built using the following hardware components:
- Firebeetle ESP32-E Microcontroller
A powerful and energy-efficient microcontroller featuring a dual-core processor, built-in Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. It ensures smooth data processing and connectivity for our device.

- Gravity Analog Infrared CO2 Sensor
The Gravity Analog Infrared CO2 Sensor accurately measures carbon dioxide (CO₂) levels in the air. It operates using infrared light to detect CO₂ absorption, one of the most reliable methods for gas measurement. This makes it an excellent choice for monitoring indoor air quality and ensuring a safe environment.

Measurement Range:
  - 0 to 5000 ppm.

- BME280 Environment Sensor

The BME280 environment sensor is designed to measure temperature, humidity, and air pressure with high precision. It utilizes advanced MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems) technology, enabling reliable multi-environment sensing. This makes it ideal for detecting changes in indoor climate conditions and maintaining optimal comfort levels.

Measurement Ranges:
  - Temperature: -40 to +85°C
  - Humidity: 0 to 100% RH
  - Pressure: 300 to 1100 hPa.

- I2C OLED Display
A compact display module that provides a clear and efficient interface for real-time data visualization. Product Link
