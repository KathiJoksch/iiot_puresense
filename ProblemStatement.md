## Overcrowding in Public Transportation  
Public transportation plays a critical role in modern urban life, providing millions of people with a convenient and affordable means of commuting. However, during peak rush hours, public transportation systems face a significant challenge: **overcrowding**. The sheer volume of passengers packed into buses, trains, and metro cars creates a stressful and uncomfortable environment for commuters.

## Impact on Air Quality  
Overcrowded spaces give rise to an often-overlooked yet critical issue: **poor air quality**. The density of passengers significantly reduces air circulation within public transportation vehicles. As the number of people increases, so does the collective release of carbon dioxide (CO₂) through respiration.  

Additional factors include:  
- **Humidity levels** often rise, creating a stuffy atmosphere.  
- **Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs)** and other pollutants accumulate in poorly ventilated spaces, further degrading air quality.

## Effects on Human Health  
Passengers experience a range of physical effects, including:  
- **Headaches**  
- **Dizziness**  
- **Difficulty breathing**  

**Vulnerable groups**, such as children, elderly individuals, and those with pre-existing respiratory conditions, are particularly at risk. Prolonged exposure to elevated levels of CO₂ and VOCs can lead to long-term health problems, such as:  
- **Respiratory diseases**  
- **Cardiovascular issues**

## Broader Implications  
Poor air quality inside public transportation negatively impacts passengers’ overall perception of these systems, potentially discouraging their use. This could result in:  
- Increased reliance on private vehicles.  
- Exacerbation of urban congestion and air pollution.

## The Need for Real-Time Monitoring  
To address this pressing issue, it is essential to prioritize **real-time air quality monitoring** within public transportation systems.  

Key requirements for an effective solution include:  
- Monitoring parameters like temperature, humidity, and air quality.  
- Presenting data in an intuitive and accessible format.  
- Empowering timely interventions, such as enhancing ventilation or activating air filtration systems.
